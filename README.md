# Learning Rust

Files and projects created while learning Rust from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.

## Prerequisites

The Rust language needs to be installed in order to compile and run the code. You can find info on how to install Rust on your machine [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Getting started

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjonhajdari/learning-rust
cd learning-rust/
```

Go inside of any module and run `cargo run` to compile and run the code.

```bash
cd module-name/submodule-name
cargo run
```
